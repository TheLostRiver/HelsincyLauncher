# AI Task Plan

## Goal

Use the stabilized `.artifacts/ai` workflow to drive current-repo backend skeleton bootstrap without regressing the single-source-of-truth task protocol.

## Current Phase

Phase 5 - Backend Skeleton Bootstrap

## Current Focus

- Use the committed workspace baseline and lockfile as the starting point for the next host bootstrap slice.
- Prepare the next host bootstrap slice that fills in `tauri.conf.json`, `main.rs`, `bootstrap.rs`, and `state.rs`.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Bootstrap and Localization

- Outcome: switched workflow surfaces to `.artifacts/ai` and introduced zh-CN/en language support.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-001, AT-2026-05-03-002
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Integration and Recovery

- Outcome: mapped planning-with-files onto `.artifacts/ai`, retired legacy root files, and repaired recovery/control-path bugs.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-003, AT-2026-05-03-004, AT-2026-05-03-005, AT-2026-05-03-006
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Command Entry Points

- Outcome: added explicit workspace slash-command prompts for planning and resume flows.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-007
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Record Schema Normalization

- Outcome: align live workflow records, templates, and session bootstrap output to one repo-specific schema inspired by planning-with-files.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-008
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 5: Backend Skeleton Bootstrap

- Outcome: establish the current-repo Rust/Tauri scaffold in atomic slices A1-A3 without disturbing the existing Next.js frontend prototype.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-009, AT-2026-05-03-010, AT-2026-05-03-011
- **Status:** in_progress

## Atomic Task Ledger

1. AT-2026-05-03-001 - committed - switched hooks, repo instructions, and workflow templates to `.artifacts/ai` and bootstrapped the new task records.
2. AT-2026-05-03-002 - committed - added zh-CN and en language modes for the repo workflow skill, translated the strict-doc skill assets to Chinese-first wording, and localized the repo-specific hook messages.
3. AT-2026-05-03-003 - committed - defined the mapping that lets planning-with-files act as the context-management layer while `.artifacts/ai` remains the only authoritative task record set.
4. AT-2026-05-03-004 - committed - retargeted the repo-local planning-with-files copy so its hooks, init flow, stop-time checks, and catchup flow operate on `.artifacts/ai` instead of root planning files.
5. AT-2026-05-03-005 - committed - archived the legacy root planning files under `.artifacts/ai/legacy-root-planning/` and removed the root copies from the active repo surface.
6. AT-2026-05-03-006 - committed - repaired the workflow control surfaces so committed tasks stop injecting as current work and repo-local recovery now covers `active-task.md` and `handoff.md` without pointing at user-global `.claude` copies.
7. AT-2026-05-03-007 - committed - added workspace slash-command prompt entry points that wrap the repo's strict-doc and planning-with-files workflow without introducing a second planning source.
8. AT-2026-05-03-008 - committed - normalized the live `.artifacts/ai` records plus repo-local planning templates and bootstrap output into one section-based schema that remains compatible with the existing AT ledger and hooks.
9. AT-2026-05-03-009 - committed - created the root Rust workspace manifest plus the smallest valid `src-tauri` member stub so backend skeleton Phase A can pass the documented metadata gate.
10. AT-2026-05-03-010 - committed - persisted the generated `Cargo.lock` so the validated workspace baseline is fully recorded and the worktree returns to clean.

## Key Questions

1. What is the smallest valid Phase A slice that creates a Rust workspace entry point without dragging in nonexistent packages?
2. Which exact files should the next host bootstrap slice own so it stays smaller than a full Tauri host implementation?

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| `.artifacts/ai` remains the only authoritative task record set | Prevents competing planning surfaces and stale recovery paths |
| The task-plan keeps a numbered AT ledger | Preserves compatibility with stop-hook and `check-complete` parsing |
| Record files should use a hybrid schema | planning-with-files contributes readable sections, while strict-doc keeps explicit atomic-task semantics |
| Backend skeleton kickoff needs a real first member | Cargo metadata rejects an empty virtual workspace, so the first valid slice must include a minimal target-bearing member |

## Follow-up Queue

1. Integrate planning-with-files' 2-action checkpoint cadence more explicitly into repo-level reminders if the adapter slice alone is not enough.
2. Start the next host bootstrap slice after the lockfile cleanup, adding `tauri.conf.json`, `main.rs`, `bootstrap.rs`, and `state.rs` on top of the validated `src-tauri` stub.

## Legacy Note

1. The old root planning history now lives under `.artifacts/ai/legacy-root-planning/` and is not the source of truth for new tasks.
2. Root `task_plan.md`, `progress.md`, and `findings.md` were removed from repo root in AT-2026-05-03-005 to prevent the legacy workflow from re-entering active execution paths.
