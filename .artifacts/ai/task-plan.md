# AI Task Plan

## Goal

Keep the repo-local workflow records structurally consistent, recoverable, and explicitly commandable while preserving `.artifacts/ai` as the only authoritative task record set.

## Current Phase

Phase 4 - Record Schema Normalization (complete)

## Current Focus

- Use the normalized `.artifacts/ai` schema as the default shape for future workflow slices.
- Keep the numbered AT ledger intact so existing hooks and `check-complete` remain compatible.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Bootstrap and Localization

- Outcome: switched workflow surfaces to `.artifacts/ai` and introduced zh-CN/en language support.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-001, AT-2026-05-03-002
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Integration and Recovery

- Outcome: mapped planning-with-files onto `.artifacts/ai`, retired legacy root files, and repaired recovery/control-path bugs.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-003, AT-2026-05-03-004, AT-2026-05-03-005, AT-2026-05-03-006
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Command Entry Points

- Outcome: added explicit workspace slash-command prompts for planning and resume flows.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-007
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Record Schema Normalization

- Outcome: align live workflow records, templates, and session bootstrap output to one repo-specific schema inspired by planning-with-files.
- Atomic tasks: AT-2026-05-03-008
- **Status:** complete

## Atomic Task Ledger

1. AT-2026-05-03-001 - committed - switched hooks, repo instructions, and workflow templates to `.artifacts/ai` and bootstrapped the new task records.
2. AT-2026-05-03-002 - committed - added zh-CN and en language modes for the repo workflow skill, translated the strict-doc skill assets to Chinese-first wording, and localized the repo-specific hook messages.
3. AT-2026-05-03-003 - committed - defined the mapping that lets planning-with-files act as the context-management layer while `.artifacts/ai` remains the only authoritative task record set.
4. AT-2026-05-03-004 - committed - retargeted the repo-local planning-with-files copy so its hooks, init flow, stop-time checks, and catchup flow operate on `.artifacts/ai` instead of root planning files.
5. AT-2026-05-03-005 - committed - archived the legacy root planning files under `.artifacts/ai/legacy-root-planning/` and removed the root copies from the active repo surface.
6. AT-2026-05-03-006 - committed - repaired the workflow control surfaces so committed tasks stop injecting as current work and repo-local recovery now covers `active-task.md` and `handoff.md` without pointing at user-global `.claude` copies.
7. AT-2026-05-03-007 - committed - added workspace slash-command prompt entry points that wrap the repo's strict-doc and planning-with-files workflow without introducing a second planning source.
8. AT-2026-05-03-008 - committed - normalized the live `.artifacts/ai` records plus repo-local planning templates and bootstrap output into one section-based schema that remains compatible with the existing AT ledger and hooks.

## Key Questions

1. Which sections must remain stable across live records, templates, and bootstrap output so future sessions stop drifting?
2. How much planning-with-files structure can we adopt without weakening the repo's strict-doc active-task protocol?

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| `.artifacts/ai` remains the only authoritative task record set | Prevents competing planning surfaces and stale recovery paths |
| The task-plan keeps a numbered AT ledger | Preserves compatibility with stop-hook and `check-complete` parsing |
| Record files should use a hybrid schema | planning-with-files contributes readable sections, while strict-doc keeps explicit atomic-task semantics |

## Follow-up Queue

1. Integrate planning-with-files' 2-action checkpoint cadence more explicitly into repo-level reminders if the adapter slice alone is not enough.

## Legacy Note

1. The old root planning history now lives under `.artifacts/ai/legacy-root-planning/` and is not the source of truth for new tasks.
2. Root `task_plan.md`, `progress.md`, and `findings.md` were removed from repo root in AT-2026-05-03-005 to prevent the legacy workflow from re-entering active execution paths.
