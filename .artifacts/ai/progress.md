# AI Progress Log

## Session: 2026-05-03

- Started AT-2026-05-03-002 to make the repo workflow skill prefer Chinese while supporting user-selectable zh-CN and en modes.
- Confirmed the most user-visible entry point is session-start, so the first localization slice is the startup reminder and bootstrap prompt.
- Verified that session-start was still reading the legacy root task_plan.md and leaking the old Fix Docs Parent Paths plan into new sessions.
- Verified that .artifacts/ai/ did not exist yet even though docs/TauriAIDevelopmentTransactionProtocolDesign.md declares it as the protocol storage location.
- Updated session-start.ps1, session-start.sh, and strict-doc-driven-development/session-start.txt to prefer .artifacts/ai records and fall back to a protocol bootstrap reminder instead of the legacy planning skill.
- Validated that the Windows session-start hook now emits the strict reminder plus the bootstrap note, without injecting the stale root plan.
- Validated that bash -n passes for the updated session-start.sh.
- Updated the remaining repo-specific hooks, workflow templates, and repo instructions to use .artifacts/ai records instead of the legacy root planning files.
- Bootstrapped .artifacts/ai/active-task.md, task-plan.md, progress.md, and findings.md so the new workflow has real task records immediately.
- Validated the PowerShell hook suite by executing session-start.ps1, pre-tool-use.ps1, error-occurred.ps1, and agent-stop.ps1 against the new .artifacts/ai records.
- Validated the Bash hook suite with bash -n across session-start.sh, pre-tool-use.sh, post-tool-use.sh, error-occurred.sh, and agent-stop.sh.
- Added .gitattributes to keep .sh files on LF and prevent future CRLF regressions in the Bash hooks.
- Re-ran bash -n and git diff --check after adding .gitattributes; both validations passed cleanly.
- Added .artifacts/ai/language-mode.txt with zh-CN as the default workflow language and MYEPIC_WORKFLOW_LANG as the environment override for English.
- Split the startup reminder and bootstrap reminder into locale-specific zh-CN and en text assets so PowerShell can stay ASCII-only while the user-visible workflow defaults to Chinese.
- Translated .github/skills/strict-doc-driven-development/SKILL.md and its bundled templates to Chinese-first wording, while documenting the bilingual language mode behavior inside the skill itself.
- Added bilingual hook message catalogs and switched session-start, pre-tool-use, post-tool-use, error-occurred, and agent-stop to load localized labels and reminders from those assets.
- Verified the Windows hook outputs in zh-CN for session-start, pre-tool-use, post-tool-use, error-occurred, and agent-stop, and verified the en override for session-start, post-tool-use, and agent-stop.
- Verified bash -n still passes for the localized session-start.sh, pre-tool-use.sh, post-tool-use.sh, error-occurred.sh, and agent-stop.sh.
- Fixed error-occurred.ps1 to parse stdin JSON reliably by avoiding PowerShell's automatic $input variable and using ConvertFrom-Json with an explicit input object.
- Confirmed the legacy strict-doc session-start.txt and session-bootstrap.txt files are no longer present; only locale-specific assets remain in .github/skills/strict-doc-driven-development/.
