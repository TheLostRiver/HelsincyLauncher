# AI Progress Log

## Session: 2026-05-03

- Verified that session-start was still reading the legacy root task_plan.md and leaking the old Fix Docs Parent Paths plan into new sessions.
- Verified that .artifacts/ai/ did not exist yet even though docs/TauriAIDevelopmentTransactionProtocolDesign.md declares it as the protocol storage location.
- Updated session-start.ps1, session-start.sh, and strict-doc-driven-development/session-start.txt to prefer .artifacts/ai records and fall back to a protocol bootstrap reminder instead of the legacy planning skill.
- Validated that the Windows session-start hook now emits the strict reminder plus the bootstrap note, without injecting the stale root plan.
- Validated that bash -n passes for the updated session-start.sh.
- Updated the remaining repo-specific hooks, workflow templates, and repo instructions to use .artifacts/ai records instead of the legacy root planning files.
- Bootstrapped .artifacts/ai/active-task.md, task-plan.md, progress.md, and findings.md so the new workflow has real task records immediately.
- Validated the PowerShell hook suite by executing session-start.ps1, pre-tool-use.ps1, error-occurred.ps1, and agent-stop.ps1 against the new .artifacts/ai records.
- Validated the Bash hook suite with bash -n across session-start.sh, pre-tool-use.sh, post-tool-use.sh, error-occurred.sh, and agent-stop.sh.
- Added .gitattributes to keep .sh files on LF and prevent future CRLF regressions in the Bash hooks.
- Re-ran bash -n and git diff --check after adding .gitattributes; both validations passed cleanly.
