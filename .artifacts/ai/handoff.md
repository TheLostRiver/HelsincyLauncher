# Handoff

## Latest Published Atomic Task

- task id: AT-2026-05-17-214
- title: Add kernel-jobs runtime policy control surface
- status: completed; final local commit `c92be25`, pushed to `origin/main`

## Current Atomic Task

- task id: AT-2026-05-17-215
- title: Define downloads runtime policy applier boundary
- status: completed locally; scoped diff check passed, commit/push pending

## Current Slice

- `docs/modules/downloads/README_IMPL.md`
- `.artifacts/ai/active-task.md`
- `.artifacts/ai/task-plan.md`
- `.artifacts/ai/progress.md`
- `.artifacts/ai/findings.md`
- `.artifacts/ai/handoff.md`

## Next Resume Point

1. Commit only AT-215 files.
2. Push `main` to `origin`.
3. If continuing, implement the documented downloads runtime policy applier port in `module-downloads` with focused TDD.

## Validation

- Required context read in focused chunks: README/docs routing, downloads module docs, README_IMPL 7.26, download runtime concurrency docs, kernel-jobs queue policy docs, composition-root ownership docs, current runtime/bootstrap/policy-store surfaces, and current PWF tails.
- Required context read in focused chunks: README_IMPL runtime-policy sections, `TauriIPCAndStateContractsDesign.md`, `TauriDownloadRuntimeDesign.md`, host transport downloads handlers, and current `SharedJobRuntimeHost` / downloads policy surfaces.
- Required context read in focused chunks: README_IMPL 7.27, kernel-jobs queue policy design, current `RuntimeQueuePolicy` / `SharedJobRuntimeHost` implementation, and PWF tails.
- AT-214 RED/GREEN validation passed for cloned runtime policy update/readback and existing runtime enqueue snapshots.
- `cargo check -p launcher-composition-root --manifest-path D:\DEV\MyEpicLauncher\Cargo.toml` passed after the runtime host shape change.
- `cargo test -p launcher-composition-root --manifest-path D:\DEV\MyEpicLauncher\Cargo.toml --lib build_job_runtime_` passed, 2 passed / 0 failed.
- `rustfmt --check crates\kernel-jobs\src\runtime.rs` passed after formatting only the AT-214 Rust file.
- Package-level `cargo fmt -p launcher-kernel-jobs --check` still reports pre-existing out-of-scope formatting diffs in `crates/kernel-jobs/src/lib.rs` and `crates/kernel-jobs/src/model.rs`; do not stage those files for AT-214.
- AT-215 required docs were read in focused chunks: README/docs routing, downloads module docs, `TauriDownloadRuntimeDesign.md`, `TauriKernelJobsRuntimeDesign.md`, `TauriCompositionRootWiringDesign.md`, current downloads facade policy code, current composition-root wiring, and PWF tails.
- AT-215 README_IMPL 7.28 defines the downloads runtime policy applier boundary and first Rust slice.
- AT-215 scoped `git diff --check` passed with CRLF normalization warnings only.

## Boundaries

- Do not modify files outside `D:\DEV\MyEpicLauncher`.
- Do not run destructive commands.
- Do not write Rust code during AT-215.
- Do not add downloads facade wiring, composition-root wiring, global settings, transport, frontend, concrete IO, retry/backoff, pending resume work mutation, active runtime job mutation, runtime lease mutation, runtime snapshot migration, or scheduler execution in AT-215.
- Push is authorized by the user-provided GitHub remote after each completed task commit.

## Dirty Worktree To Preserve

- Unrelated unstaged/unknown work remains present and must not be committed with AT-215:
  - `Cargo.lock`
  - `MyEpicLauncher.pen`
  - frontend files under `app/` and `components/`
  - sqlite files under `crates/composition-root/` and `src-tauri/`
  - `.codex` files
  - `src/`
  - `crates/composition-root/src/startup.rs`
